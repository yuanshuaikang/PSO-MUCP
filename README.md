## We store the data needed to run the experiment in the DATA folder, which contains six data sets.

#### The dataset contains three real datasets and three synthetic datasets.<br><br><br>



## The algorithm of the paper and the algorithm of the comparative experiment are stored in the HUCPM folder

#### The folder contains the PSO-MUCP algorithm proposed in the paper. At the same time, we set up three comparative algorithms, including CQ-HUCPM algorithm, EHUCM algorithm, and EPA algorithm.<br><br><br>
